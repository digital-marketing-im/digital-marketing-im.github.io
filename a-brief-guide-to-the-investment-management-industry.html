        <p>Let's use an example to help decribe how the industry functions. The main players in this scenario are <strong>you</strong> and <strong>me</strong> (known as <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retail investors</a>), <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> (a B2C financial services firm), and two investment management firms: <strong>Vanguard</strong> and <strong>PIMCO</strong>.</p>

        <h2 id="business-to-consumer-b2c" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Business-to-consumer (B2C)</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#business-to-consumer-b2c"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h2>

        <p>You and I have decided to start investing, so we head over to the <a class="external" href="https://www.hl.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hargreaves Lansdown website</a>, fill in a form with our details, and each open an investment account. We add money by setting up a monthly transfer of £1,000 from our bank accounts. Now we need to choose what investments to buy.</p>
        
        <p>Picking individual stocks or bonds is not something we're interested in (we have no idea where to start), so we decide to invest in <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funds</a> instead. This outsources day-to-day investment decisions to professionals at investment management firms, who will choose which stocks and bonds to buy in their fund (called <strong>active management</strong>), or copy the investments in an <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">index</a> (<strong>passive management</strong>). We have to pay a fee for these services, but we think it's worth the extra cost.</p>

        <p>After doing some research on suitable funds, you plan to invest in the <a class="external" href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-global-all-cap-index-fund-gbp-acc/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund</a> to try and grow your investment over the long term. I choose the <a class="external" href="https://www.pimco.co.uk/en-gb/investments/gis/income-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIMCO GIS Income Fund</a>, which I am hoping will generate me a steady stream of income.</p>

        <p>We’re all set! Hargreaves Lansdown will automatically transfer £1,000 from our bank accounts to our investment accounts every month and invest it in our chosen funds. To check our balance, buy or sell investments, or print out statements, we simply need to login to our online account.</p>


        <h2 id="business-to-business-b2b" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Business-to-business (B2B)</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#business-to-business-b2b"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h2>
                
        <p>In our example, note that retail investors like you and I don't interact with PIMCO or Vanguard directly, even though they each manage a fund we've chosen. The two firms only interact with Hargeaves Landsdown &mdash; in this case, sales teams attempt to get funds added as options on Hargreaves Landsdown's website, so retail investors like you and I can buy them. This is known as <strong>business-to-business (B2B)</strong>.</p>

        <p>However, there's a key difference here: Vanguard also work with retail investors. If you wanted to buy the Vanguard fund, you could simply <a class="external" href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investing-explained/investment-account-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open up an investment account with them</a> and buy it directly, instead of going through Hargreaves Landsdown.</p>
        
        <p>In contrast, PIMCO doesn’t deal with retail investors at all. To buy their fund I either have to use a B2C investment platform (like Hargeaves Lansdown), or access it through a financial intermediary: <strong>financial advisors</strong> and <strong>institutional investors</strong>. Let's develop our example a little further to explore these.</p>
                
        <h3>Financial advisors</h3>
                
        <p>Let's say you suddenly win £5 million on the National Lottery. As you're now pretty wealthy, hiring a <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_adviser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial advisor</a> to manage your money seems like a good idea. They can help with any additional complexities you might face: estate planning, tax, retirement, and so on.</p>
                
        <p>Financial advisors come in different shapes and sizes, and offer different levels of service. Once you've chosen one that you like, and had a chat with them to determine your goals and appetite for risk, they will get on with the business of managing your finances. This will usually involve selecting funds for you.</p>
               
        <p>Broadly, advisors will have a range of approved funds they can use. They will select from these funds when they get a new client, depending on that client's goals. As you can probably imagine, investment management firms want their funds on these shortlists: advisors are likely to invest new client money in those funds. This is a key goal for sales and marketing.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, investment management firms are offering a product called <strong>model portfolios</strong> to financial advisors. This guide includes a chapter dedicated to <a href="">launching and marketing a range of model portfolios</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>Institutional investors</h3>
        
        <p>I have a workplace pension. A pension fund, also known as a superannuation fund in some countries, is any plan, fund, or scheme that provides retirement income. Pension funds are pooled monetary contributions from pension plans set up by employers, unions, or other organizations to provide for their employees' or members' retirement benefits. Pension funds are the largest investment blocks in most countries and dominate the stock markets where they invest. When managed by professional fund managers, they constitute the institutional investor sector along with insurance companies and investment trusts. Typically, pension funds are exempt from capital gains tax and the earnings on their investment portfolios are either tax-deferred or tax exempt.</p>
        
        <p>An institutional investor is a legal entity that accumulates the funds of numerous investors (which may be private investors or other legal entities) to invest in various financial instruments and profit from the process. In other words, an institutional investor is an organization that invests on behalf of its members.</p>
        
        <p>An institutional investor buys, sells, and manages stocks, bonds, and other investment securities on behalf of its clients, customers, members, or shareholders. Broadly speaking, there are six types of institutional investors: endowment funds, commercial banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds, and insurance companies. Institutional investors face fewer protective regulations compared to average investors because it is assumed the institutional crowd is more knowledgeable and better able to protect themselves.</p>
        
        <h2>Winning new business</h2>       
        
        <p>So how do investment management firms try to win new business? Here's a list:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Solid inbvestment process products. Those products might have great performance</li>
          <li>Products with track records</li>
          <li>Story</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Model portfolios: link</a></p>

          <span class="flex-grow-1">Marketing challenges</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#marketing-challenges"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h2>
        
        <p>Beyond day-to-day work and projects, there are a lot of factors that make the job more difficult than it needs to be.
        
        <h3>Measuring the marketing team's contribution</h3>
        
        <p>Difficulty measuring the marketing team's contribution. The sales cycle in investment management B2B is typically non-linear and can be very long, with multiple touchpoints and decision makers along the way. Therefore, it’s essentially impossible to measure marketing’s contribution to flows accurately (despite what many marketing agencies will tell you in their pitches).</p>
        
        <h3>Old-fashioned and old-school</h3>
        
        <p>It’s old-fashioned</strong>. Investment management is slow moving, is relationship-led and it can still be an old-school relationship led business, where many salespeople – especially in the institutional channel – prize their clients and prefer to meet in person, with a “hands-off” mentality towards marketing. In some firms, the sales team may not want leads sent to them at all</p>
        
        <h3>Overcoming a poor reputation</h3>
        
        <p>Marketing often has a bad reputation around the business. To be frank, lots of marketing teams can be ineffective and project a bad experience with the sales team, rather than demonstrate how they can help sales do better at scale.</p>
          
        <h3>Profits</h3>
        
        <p>Investment management firms make a lot of money, and so there seems to be a lack of pressure on the marketing team. Sometimes it can feel like you're playing at your job, and that nothing you do will really have any impact. It's important to note that this is changing however, as new disrusptive companies move in and fee pressures bite</p> -->
