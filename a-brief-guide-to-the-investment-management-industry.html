        <p>You may have heard of the S&P 500 or the FTSE 100. These are both examples of a stock market <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">index</a>. To track the performance of our five-company stock market, IndexCo, Inc. &mdash; a company that creates market indices &mdash; creates a new index, naming it the <strong>IndexCo Stock Market Index</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>IndexCo chooses an initial value of <strong>100.0</strong> for the index, which is launched at the start of the year. At the end of the year, a new index value is calculated. This calculation (shown in figure 2) uses the final prices of each of the five stocks at the end of the year and their weights from the start of the year.</p>
                
        <p>The weight of each stock in the index at the start of the year &mdash; based on the market capitalisation of the company &mdash; determines how much it's price change during the year will affect the overall price change of the index.</p>

        <p>Here's how we calculate our new index value:</p>

        <div class="bd-callout">       
          <p>Initial index value &times; Sum of weighted price changes &equals; New index value</p>
        </div>    

        <p>Plugging in the values:</p>

        <div class="bd-callout">
          <p>100.0 &times; 1.0597 &equals; <strong>106.0</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>From this, we can calculate the performance of the overall index:</p>

        <div class="bd-callout">       
          <p>(New index value &divide; initial index value) &minus; 1 &equals; 1 year index price change</p>
        </div>    
       
        <p>Plugging in the values:</p>

        <div class="bd-callout">
          <p>(106.0 &divide; 100.0) &minus; 1 &equals; <strong>6.0%</strong></p>
        </div>
 
        <p>Our stock market performance can now be reported: it increased by <strong>6.0%</strong> during the year. Real indices are calculated and reported more frequently &mdash; usually for every day the market is open. We have also ignored any <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dividends</a> paid out by the five companies for simplicity (we will discuss these shortly).</p>
        
        <p>It will also be used as a benchmark.</p>
        
        <p>An point to note here is that that the index is simply a calculated number. It can't be bought as an investment. We will cover how investors can access the stock market in the next section.</p>

        <h2 id="investing-in-the-stock-market" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Investing in the stock market</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#investing-in-the-stock-market"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h2>
        
        <p>Investors would like access to our stock market &mdash; to be able to invest in the stocks that comprise it. That way they can benefit from the price growth of the investment over time, and to receive any dividends that the companies pay out to shareholders.</p>
        
        <p>The first step is to open up an <strong>investment account</strong> which will hold any investments. Investment accounts include standard accounts, tax-advantaged accounts, or self-invested pensions. Once opened, account holders can transfer cash to their investment account from their bank accounts and set up regular cash transfers.<p>
        
        <p>An online brokerage firm, WebBroker, offer a range of investment accounts which can be opened on their website. Each account costs $25 a year.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, investors choose which investments to buy. In our simplfied example, account holders have two options: <strong>shares</strong> and <strong>mutual funds</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3 id="shares" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Shares</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#shares"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h3>

        <p>One option is to buy and sell the individual company shares. Account holders can buy and sell shares for $5 per trade through WebBroker. The owner of a share will receive any dividends paid out by a company.</p>
                
        <h3 id="mutual-funds" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Mutual funds</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#mutual-funds"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h3>
        
        <p>Those who don't want the hassle of choosing individual stocks can invest in a <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mutual fund</a> instead. Investing in a mutual fund outsources day-to-day investment decisions to professionals at an investment management firm.</p>

        <p>Depending on the type of mutual fund, these professionals will either (1) buy the same investments in the same weights as the index and make regular adjustments to make sure they match to mimic it's performance  (passive) or (2) perform in-depth research the stocks and choose which to hold in their mutual fund (active management).</p>
        
        <p>An advantage of most mutual funds is <strong>diversification</strong>. Rather than owning one share, the investor can just buy one fund which will hold all five.</p>
        
        <p>Buying and selling mutual funds is free through WebBroker &mdash; however, as we will see, mutual funds have their own built-in management fee. It's up to each investor if they think this fee is worth the cost.</p>
              
        <p>To continue with our example, investors have a choice of two mutual funds: a <strong>passively managed index fund</strong> and an <strong>actively managed fund</strong>.</p>
       
        <h4 id="passively-managed-index-fund" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Passively managed index fund</span>

        <p>IndexFundCo, an investment management firm, launches an index fund: the <strong>IndexFundCo Stock Market Index Fund</strong>. This will hold the same investments as the stock market index, in exactly the same weights. It will be rebalanced once every year. It will allow investors to get access to the stock market without having to buy the individual stocks.</p>

        <p>At launch, several investors contribute money to the new fund, totalling $800,000. The IndexCo fund manager purchases stocks with the invested money, in the same weights as the index (see figure 2).</p>

        <p>In our example, stocks can only be bought whole, so after buying shares for the fund there is a little left over as cash. This means performance will vary slightly from the index it aims to replicate. The index will be used as a benchmark when comparing performance. With an index fund, they should be very close. It's more important when we look at actively managed funds.</p>

        <p>As we will see, as the fee is taken out of the fund each year, this will reduce the performance of each shareclass by the amount of the fee. Performance of each shareclass will therefore be different. Of the two funds, the IndexCo will have a cheaper fee.</p></p>
        
        <p>Each share class also has two types: Acc and Inc. These determine what will happen to dividends received by the funds. If Apple pays a dividend, the Acc shareclass will reinvest it in the shares of Apple. The inc will pay that out to the fund investor.</p>

        <p>Picking individual stocks or bonds is not something we're interested in (we have no idea where to start), so we decide to invest in <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mutual funds</a> instead. This outsources day-to-day investment decisions to professionals at investment management firms, who will choose which stocks and bonds to buy in their mutual fund (called <strong>active management</strong>), or copy the investments in an <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">index</a> (<strong>passive management</strong>). We have to pay a fee for these services, but we think it's worth the extra cost.</p>

        <p>After doing some research on suitable funds, you plan to invest in the <a class="external" href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-global-all-cap-index-fund-gbp-acc/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund</a> to try and grow your investment over the long term.

        <p>We’re all set! Hargreaves Lansdown will automatically transfer £1,000 from our bank accounts to our investment accounts every month and invest it in our chosen funds.

        <p>Mutual funds have different fees for different investment amounts. Generally divided into retail and institutional investors. Products designed for middle-income individual investors, such as the retail classes of mutual funds, often have modest initial investment requirements. Managed strategies for institutions can have imposing minimum investment requirements that can be as high as $25 million or more. </p>

        <h2 id="business-to-business-b2b" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Business-to-business (B2B)</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#business-to-business-b2b"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h2>
                
        <p>In our example, note that retail investors like you and I don't interact with PIMCO or Vanguard directly, even though they each manage a fund we've chosen. The two firms only interact with Hargeaves Landsdown &mdash; in this case, sales teams attempt to get funds added as options on Hargreaves Landsdown's website, so retail investors like you and I can buy them. This is known as <strong>business-to-business (B2B)</strong>.</p>

        <p>However, there's a key difference here: Vanguard also work with retail investors. If you wanted to buy the Vanguard fund, you could simply <a class="external" href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investing-explained/investment-account-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open up an investment account with them</a> and buy it directly, instead of going through Hargreaves Landsdown.</p>
        
        <p>In contrast, PIMCO doesn’t deal with retail investors at all. To buy their fund I either have to use a B2C investment platform (like Hargeaves Lansdown), or access it through a financial intermediary: <strong>financial advisors</strong> or <strong>institutional investors</strong>. Let's develop our example a little further to explore these.</p>
        
        <h3 id="financial-advisors" class="d-flex">

        </h3>

        <p>Let's say you suddenly win £5 million on the National Lottery. As you're now pretty wealthy, hiring a <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_adviser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial advisor</a> to manage your money seems like a good idea. They can help with any additional complexities you might face: estate planning, tax, retirement, and so on.</p>
                
        <p>Financial advisors come in different shapes and sizes, and offer different levels of service. Once you've chosen one that you like, and had a chat with them to determine your goals and appetite for risk, they will get on with the business of managing your finances. This will usually involve selecting funds for you.</p>
               
        <p>Broadly, advisors will have a range of approved funds they can use. They will select from these funds when they get a new client, depending on that client's goals. As you can probably imagine, investment management firms want their funds on these shortlists: advisors are likely to invest new client money in those funds. This is a key goal for sales and marketing.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, investment management firms are increasingly offering a product called <strong>model portfolios</strong> to financial advisors. We cover model portfolios in a <a href="">case study</a> on how to launch and market them for our <a href="/introducing-our-fictional-investment-management-firm.html">fictional investment management firm</a>.</p>

        </h3>
        
        <p>Let's assume I have a 9 to 5 job at Ford Motor Company which comes with a nice perk: a defined benefit pension. Each month, employees who pay in contributions are considered members of the pension scheme. When a member retires, the pension will pay them retirement income.</p>
        
        <p>Member contributions are pooled and invested by the managers of the Ford Motor Company Pension Fund on behalf of those members. These managers perform a similar role to professional managers of mutual funds, deciding how to invest money. They also have a specific (and very important) goal of providing the promised retirement income.</p>
        
        <p>Pension funds are an example of <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">institutional investors</a>. Considered to be more sophisticated than retail investors, institutional investors often manage very large pools of money and dedicate significant resources to researching prospective investments. Other types of institutional investors include insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds. Funnily enough, mutual funds themselves are also considered institutional investors.</p>
                               
        <p>The managers of the Ford Motor Company Pension Fund may allocate a portion of contributions to invest in the PIMCO GIS Income Fund &mdash; like I did with my own money &mdash; to try and help to deliver income for members who have retired. If they did invest in the mutual fund, they would pay the lowest possible fee for the fund (through the insitutional share class). However, as a large institutional inevestor, they have another option available: a <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/separateaccount.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate account</a>, also known as <strong>separately managed accounts (SMAs)</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Instead of investing in the mutual fund, the pension fund could choose to open a separate account with PIMCO. This separate account could start with the "blueprint" of the PIMCO GIS Income Fund, with exactly same investments in the same weights as the "off-the-shelf" mutual fund. However, as the separate account would be managed entirely separately (the money in the separate account is not pooled alongside the money of other investors in the mutual fund), investments within it can be fully customised for the pension fund, if desired.</p>
               
        <p>In addition, fees are usually lower for separate accounts than for actively managed mutual funds as they don't require the same level of regulatory reporting and administration.</p>
