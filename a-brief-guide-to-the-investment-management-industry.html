        <p>Let's use an example to help decribe how the industry functions. The main players in this scenario are <strong>you</strong> and <strong>me</strong> (known as <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retail investors</a>), <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> (a B2C financial services firm), and two investment management firms: <strong>Vanguard</strong> and <strong>PIMCO</strong>.</p>

        <h2 id="business-to-consumer-b2c" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Business-to-consumer (B2C)</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#business-to-consumer-b2c"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h2>

        <p>You and I have decided to start investing, so we head over to the <a class="external" href="https://www.hl.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hargreaves Lansdown website</a>, fill in a form with our details, and each open an investment account. We add money by setting up a monthly transfer of £1,000 from our bank accounts. Now we need to choose what investments to buy.</p>
        
        <p>Picking individual stocks or bonds is not something we're interested in (we have no idea where to start), so we decide to invest in <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mutual funds</a> instead. This outsources day-to-day investment decisions to professionals at investment management firms, who will choose which stocks and bonds to buy in their mutual fund (called <strong>active management</strong>), or copy the investments in an <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">index</a> (<strong>passive management</strong>). We have to pay a fee for these services, but we think it's worth the extra cost.</p>

        <p>After doing some research on suitable funds, you plan to invest in the <a class="external" href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-global-all-cap-index-fund-gbp-acc/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund</a> to try and grow your investment over the long term. I choose the <a class="external" href="https://www.pimco.co.uk/en-gb/investments/gis/income-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIMCO GIS Income Fund</a>, which I am hoping will generate me a steady stream of income.</p>

        <p>We’re all set! Hargreaves Lansdown will automatically transfer £1,000 from our bank accounts to our investment accounts every month and invest it in our chosen funds. To check our balance, buy or sell investments, or print out statements, we simply need to login to our online account.</p>

        <h2 id="product-fees" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Product fees</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#product-fees"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h2>

        <p>Mutual funds have different fees for different investment amounts. Generally divided into retail and institutional investors. Products designed for middle-income individual investors, such as the retail classes of mutual funds, often have modest initial investment requirements. Managed strategies for institutions can have imposing minimum investment requirements that can be as high as $25 million or more. </p>

        <h2 id="business-to-business-b2b" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Business-to-business (B2B)</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#business-to-business-b2b"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h2>
                
        <p>In our example, note that retail investors like you and I don't interact with PIMCO or Vanguard directly, even though they each manage a fund we've chosen. The two firms only interact with Hargeaves Landsdown &mdash; in this case, sales teams attempt to get funds added as options on Hargreaves Landsdown's website, so retail investors like you and I can buy them. This is known as <strong>business-to-business (B2B)</strong>.</p>

        <p>However, there's a key difference here: Vanguard also work with retail investors. If you wanted to buy the Vanguard fund, you could simply <a class="external" href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investing-explained/investment-account-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open up an investment account with them</a> and buy it directly, instead of going through Hargreaves Landsdown.</p>
        
        <p>In contrast, PIMCO doesn’t deal with retail investors at all. To buy their fund I either have to use a B2C investment platform (like Hargeaves Lansdown), or access it through a financial intermediary: <strong>financial advisors</strong> or <strong>institutional investors</strong>. Let's develop our example a little further to explore these.</p>
        
        <h3 id="financial-advisors" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Financial advisors</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#financial-advisors"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h3>

        <p>Let's say you suddenly win £5 million on the National Lottery. As you're now pretty wealthy, hiring a <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_adviser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial advisor</a> to manage your money seems like a good idea. They can help with any additional complexities you might face: estate planning, tax, retirement, and so on.</p>
                
        <p>Financial advisors come in different shapes and sizes, and offer different levels of service. Once you've chosen one that you like, and had a chat with them to determine your goals and appetite for risk, they will get on with the business of managing your finances. This will usually involve selecting funds for you.</p>
               
        <p>Broadly, advisors will have a range of approved funds they can use. They will select from these funds when they get a new client, depending on that client's goals. As you can probably imagine, investment management firms want their funds on these shortlists: advisors are likely to invest new client money in those funds. This is a key goal for sales and marketing.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, investment management firms are increasingly offering a product called <strong>model portfolios</strong> to financial advisors. We cover model portfolios in a <a href="">case study</a> on how to launch and market them for our <a href="/introducing-our-fictional-investment-management-firm.html">fictional investment management firm</a>.</p>
        
        <h3 id="institutional-investors" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Institutional investors</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#institutional-investors"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h3>
        
        <p>Let's assume I have a 9 to 5 job at Ford Motor Company which comes with a nice perk: a defined benefit pension. Each month, employees who pay in contributions are considered members of the pension scheme. When a member retires, the pension will pay them retirement income.</p>
        
        <p>Member contributions are pooled and invested by the managers of the Ford Motor Company Pension Fund on behalf of those members. These managers perform a similar role to professional managers of mutual funds, deciding how to invest money. They also have a specific (and very important) goal of providing the promised retirement income.</p>
        
        <p>Pension funds are an example of <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">institutional investors</a>. Considered to be more sophisticated than retail investors, institutional investors often manage very large pools of money and dedicate significant resources to researching prospective investments. Other types of institutional investors include insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds. Funnily enough, mutual funds themselves are also considered institutional investors.</p>
                               
        <p>The managers of the Ford Motor Company Pension Fund may allocate a portion of contributions to invest in the PIMCO GIS Income Fund &mdash; like I did with my own money &mdash; to try and help to deliver income for members who have retired. If they did invest in the mutual fund, they would pay the lowest possible fee for the fund (through the insitutional share class). However, as a large institutional inevestor, they have another option available: a <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/separateaccount.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate account</a>, also known as <strong>separately managed accounts (SMAs)</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Instead of investing in the mutual fund, the pension fund could choose to open a separate account with PIMCO. This separate account could start with the "blueprint" of the PIMCO GIS Income Fund, with exactly same investments in the same weights as the "off-the-shelf" mutual fund. However, as the separate account would be managed entirely separately (the money in the separate account is not pooled alongside the money of other investors in the mutual fund), investments within it can be fully customised for the pension fund, if desired.</p>
               
        <p>In addition, fees are usually lower for separate accounts than for actively managed mutual funds as they don't require the same level of regulatory reporting and administration.</p>

        </h2>
        
        <p>Beyond day-to-day work and projects, there are a lot of factors that make the job more difficult than it needs to be.
        
        <h3>Measuring the marketing team's contribution</h3>
        
        <p>Difficulty measuring the marketing team's contribution. The sales cycle in investment management B2B is typically non-linear and can be very long, with multiple touchpoints and decision makers along the way. Therefore, it’s essentially impossible to measure marketing’s contribution to flows accurately (despite what many marketing agencies will tell you in their pitches).</p>
        
        <h3>Old-fashioned and old-school</h3>
        
        <p>It’s old-fashioned</strong>. Investment management is slow moving, is relationship-led and it can still be an old-school relationship led business, where many salespeople – especially in the institutional channel – prize their clients and prefer to meet in person, with a “hands-off” mentality towards marketing. In some firms, the sales team may not want leads sent to them at all</p>
        
        <h3>Overcoming a poor reputation</h3>
        
        <p>Marketing often has a bad reputation around the business. To be frank, lots of marketing teams can be ineffective and project a bad experience with the sales team, rather than demonstrate how they can help sales do better at scale.</p>
          
        <h3>Profits</h3>
        
        <p>Investment management firms make a lot of money, and so there seems to be a lack of pressure on the marketing team. Sometimes it can feel like you're playing at your job, and that nothing you do will really have any impact. It's important to note that this is changing however, as new disrusptive companies move in and fee pressures bite</p> -->
