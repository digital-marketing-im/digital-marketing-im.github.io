        <hr>

        <p>At some point in your career you might have been tasked with devising a <strong>digital marketing strategy</strong> for your team, but in my experience most investment management firms don't have one.</p>
        
        <p>Without a strategy in place, the digital marketing team lacks direction and focus. As I've experienced myself (many times), team members simply spend each day playing whack-a-mole with random, aimless projects &mdash; such as collecting leads through a website form with no idea why, nor anyone to send the leads to.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-a-digital-marketing-strategy" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">What is a digital marketing strategy?</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#what-is-a-digital-marketing-strategy"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h2>
          
        <p>A digital marketing strategy is a plan that documents <strong>what</strong> you want to achieve, and <strong>how</strong> you will achieve it. Putting one in place will add structure and clarity to your approach, ensure that everyday tasks and projects have a larger purpose, highlight bad processes, and force teams to use software and other tools properly.</p>
        
        <p>Creating a strategy may seem like a daunting task, especially with all the various tools, techniques, and buzzwords on the topic. It's hard to know where to begin. But don't worry &mdash; there's hope! You can use a marketing methodology called <a class="external" href="https://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inbound marketing</a> (or <strong>permission marketing</strong>) to build your strategy, which is comprised of a series of easily explainable steps, each of which can form a part of your digital marketing strategy.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-inbound-marketing" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">What is inbound marketing?</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#what-is-inbound-marketing"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h2>

        <p>The general idea behind inbound marketing involves publishing content that provides value and offers solutions to problems that your target audience care about &mdash; without shoving it in their faces. They find your content in their own time (usually from a Google search) and visit your website. At this point, your goal is to convert these visitors into leads, qualify and nurture them, and pass them to the sales team when ready.</p>
          
        <p>This works in direct contrast to <strong>outbound marketing</strong> (or <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interruption_marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interruption marketing</a>) where annoying techniques like telemarketing, cold-calling, and spam emails are used to forcefully get your attention.</p>
 
        <h3 id="inbound-marketing-as-a-framework" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Inbound marketing as a framework</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#inbound-marketing-as-a-framework"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h3>

        <p>The inbound marketing methodology is so useful because each step can be used as a clearly defined high-level component of your digital marketing strategy.</p> 
          
        <p>According to HubSpot, who coined the term back in 2006, there are three steps to inbound marketing &mdash; <strong>attract</strong>, <strong>engage</strong>, and <strong>delight</strong>. To account for the peculiarities of B2B investment management, however, we're going to modify the more traditional approach.</p>
        
        <p>Our new inbound marketing framework is shown in figure 1.</p>
        
        <div class="table-responsive">
          <table class="table table-bordered small text-wrap">

                <td>
                  <p class="mb-0">Qualify contacts by grading suitability and scoring activity using marketing automation software, notifying the sales team for a follow-up when a prospect meets pre-defined score thresholds for website activity.</p>
                  </td>
              </tr>                    
              <tr>
                <th scope="row" class="w-20 align-top table-light">Inform</th>
                <td>

                </td>
              </tr>                   
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>  
                
        <p>This framework will form the basis for your digital marketing strategy. Additionally, it can be adapted further to fit the specific business models, goals, and cultures of individual investment management firms. We'll return to this later.</p>

        </h3>
        
        <p>Some of the language used in figure 1 to describe prospective clients at each step in their journey can be confusing, so let's clarify what they mean:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Lead</strong> &mdash; someone who has submitted their personal details, and had a new contact record created for them in the marketing automation system, but has not been qualified by the marketing team as a valid prospect yet.</li>         
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Prospect</strong> &mdash; also known as a <strong>marketing qualified lead (MQL)</strong>. A lead who has been qualified by the marketing team as a potential opportunity based on that contact's personal details (company, job title, location).</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Opportunity</strong> &mdash; also known as a <strong>sales qualified lead (SQL)</strong>. A prospect that has had a successful interaction with sales and a CRM record has been created for them with an assigned sales person. Importantly, opportunities include those who have not yet invested any money with the firm, current clients who have money invested, and previous clients who no longer hold any investments.</li> 
          <li><strong>Contact</strong> &mdash; a combination of all leads, prospects and opportunities that make up a firm's <strong>mailing list</strong>.</li>           
        </ul>

        <h2 id="next-steps" class="d-flex">
          <span class="flex-grow-1">Next steps</span>
          <a class="anchor-link" href="#next-steps"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a>
        </h2>

        <p>We need to begin fleshing out our high-level framework. We start by setting a goal for our strategy to give it purpose and direction.</p>
