        <p>Welcome! This guide was created to help digital marketers succeed in a very challenging industry. Existing resources tend to be laden with buzzwords, purely theoretical, and impossible to apply to real-world situations.</p>
        
        <h2 id="who-is-this-guide-for">Who is this guide for?<a class="anchor-link" href="#who-is-this-guide-for"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>This guide is primarily aimed at digital marketing professionals who sit within the marketing teams of B2B investment management firms. However, anyone may find parts of it useful.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-will-this-guide-help-you">How will this guide help you?<a class="anchor-link" href="#how-will-this-guide-help-you"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>This guide will help you create your own digital marketing strategy. We will use a <a href="/introducing-our-fictional-investment-management-firm.html">fictional investment management firm</a> to help explain key concepts and demonstrate how to tackle real-life projects, which you can then adapt for your own use.</p>
        
        <h2 id="a-quick-primer-on-investment-management">A quick primer on investment management<a class="anchor-link" href="#a-quick-primer-on-investment-management"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>To help us understand how the industry functions, let’s start with an example. The various players in this scenario are <strong>you and me</strong> (known as <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retail investors</a>), <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> (a B2C financial services firm), and two investment management firms: <strong>Vanguard</strong> and <strong>PIMCO</strong>.</p>
       
        <h3>B2C investment management</h3>

        <p>You and I have decided to start investing our money instead of keeping it all in a bank savings account, so we head on over to the <a class="external" href="https://www.hl.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hargreaves Lansdown website</a>, fill in a form with our details, and each open an investment account.</p>
        
        <p>Once our investment accounts are open, we add money to them by setting up a transfer of £1,000 from our bank accounts every month. However, as it stands, any money we add will just sit as cash in the investment account until we invest it. So, our next step is to choose what to investments to buy.</p>
        
        <p>Investing in individual stocks (like Apple or Walmart) is not something we're interested in, because we have no idea where to start. The same applies to bonds too. Instead, we will invest in <strong>funds</strong>. After performing a little research to find a suitable fund for our needs, you plan to invest your £1,000 in the <a class="external fw-bold" href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-global-all-cap-index-fund-gbp-acc/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund</a> each month, with the aim of growing your investment over the long term. I, on the other hand, choose the <a class="external fw-bold" href="https://www.pimco.co.uk/en-gb/investments/gis/income-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIMCO GIS Income Fund</a>, which I hope will generate a steady income stream.</p>
        
        <p>We’re all set! Each month, Hargreaves Lansdown will automatically transfer £1,000 from our bank accounts to our investment accounts and invest in in our chosen funds. We can visit their website to view our account balance and make changes any time we like. That's B2C investment management in a nutshell.</p>
        
        <h3>B2B investment management</h3>
                
        <p>In our example above, note that retail investors like you and I don't interact with PIMCO or Vanguard directly. However, the two firms have different business models: Vanguard work with both retail (B2C) and professional (B2B) investors, whereas PIMCO focus only on professional (B2B) investors.</p>
        
        <p>You could have opened up an investment account with Vanguard and invested in their fund directly, instead of using Hargreaves Landsdown. In contrast, PIMCO doesn’t deal with retail investors like you or me at all. I can't invest in their fund through them &mdash; I have to invest in them indirectly through an B2C firm. PIMCO will have a dedicated sales team that tries to get their funds added as investment options on platforms like Hargreaves Landsdown.</p>
        
        <p>PIMCO and Vanguard's B2B business will have two main client groups that will form the bulk of their assets under management: <strong>financial advisors</strong> and <strong>institutional investors</strong>. Let's develop our example a little more to explore these.</p>
        
        <h4>Financial advisors</h4>
        
        <p>Suddently you win £1 million on the lottery. That's a lot of money, so you hire a financial advisor to help manage your money sensibly.</p>
        
        <p>The B2B investment management firm would then work with the financial advisor.</p>
        
        <h4>Institutional investors</h4>
        
        <p>Additionally, you may have a workplace pension.</p>
            
        <h2 id="industry-specific-marketing-challenges">Industry-specific marketing challenges<a class="anchor-link" href="#industry-specific-marketing-challenges"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>Beyond day-to-day work and projects, there are a lot of factors that make the job more difficult than it needs to be:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Difficulty measuring the marketing team's contribution</strong>. The sales cycle in investment management B2B is typically non-linear and can be very long, with multiple touchpoints and decision makers along the way. Therefore, it’s essentially impossible to measure marketing’s contribution to flows accurately (despite what many marketing agencies will tell you in their pitches).</li>
          <li><strong>It’s old-fashioned</strong>. Investment management is slow moving, is relationship-led and it can still be an old-school relationship led business, where many salespeople – especially in the institutional channel – prize their clients and prefer to meet in person, with a “hands-off” mentality towards marketing. In some firms, the sales team may not want leads sent to them at all</li>
          <li><strong>Marketing often has a bad reputation around the business</strong>. To be frank, lots of marketing teams can be ineffective and project a bad experience with the sales team, rather than demonstrate how they can help sales do better at scale.</li>
          <li><strong>High profits</strong>. Investment management firms make a lot of money, and so there seems to be a lack of pressure on the marketing team. Sometimes it can feel like you're playing at your job, and that nothing you do will really have any impact. It's important to note that this is changing however, as new disrusptive companies move in and fee pressures bite</li>
