        <p>I created this guide to help digital marketers succeed in a very challenging industry. Existing resources tend to be laden with buzzwords, purely theoretical, and impossible to apply to real-world situations.</p>
        
        <h2 id="who-is-this-guide-for">Who is this guide for?<a class="anchor-link" href="#who-is-this-guide-for"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>This guide is primarily aimed at digital marketing professionals who sit within the marketing teams of B2B investment management firms. However, anyone may find parts of it useful.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-will-this-guide-help-you">How will this guide help you?<a class="anchor-link" href="#how-will-this-guide-help-you"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>This guide will help you create your own digital marketing strategy. We will use a <a href="/introducing-our-fictional-investment-management-firm.html">fictional investment management firm</a> to explain concepts and demonstrate how to tackle real-life projects, which you can then adapt for your own use.</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-is-b2b-investment-management">What is B2B investment management?<a class="anchor-link" href="#what-is-b2b-investment-management"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>To describe the industry most clearly, we will use an example. The various players in this typical scenario are:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>You and me, both retail investors</li>
          <li>Hargeaves Landsdown, a B2C financial services firm</li>
          <li>Vanguard and PIMCO, both investment management firms</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You and I have both decided to start investing. As a first step, we visit the Hargreaves Lansdown website, fill in a form with our details, and each open an investment account.</p>
        
        <p>Once our investment accounts are open, we then need to add money to them. We both decide to transfer in £1,000 from our bank accounts every month.</p>
        
        <p>As it stands, that £1,000 will just sit as cash in the investment account until we invest it. So, our next step is to decide what to investments to buy.</p>
        
        <p>We decide against investing in individual stocks – like Apple or Walmart – or bonds, as we have no idea where to start. Instead, we both decide to invest in funds. We both perform a little research on the HL website to find a suitable fund for our needs.</p>
        
        <p>Eventually, you decide to invest the £1,000 in the Vanguard fund, as you want to invest in stocks around to grow your investment over the long- term. I, on the other hand, choose the PIMCO Income Fund, which should generate a steady income over time for me.</p>
        
        <p>We’re all set! Each month, we will automatically pay money into our investment account, and that money will be invested in our chosen fund. We can view our balance on the HL website.</p>
        
        <p>We will pay a small fee to HL for the investment account and maybe some fees every time we buy or sell the fund itself. The funds themselves also have a fee too, but this is built into the investment itself and so we won’t see any payments coming in our out.</p>
        
        <p>Fees (_)</p>
        
        <p>That’s B2C investment management.</p>
        
        <p>Notice how we don’t interact with PIMCO or Vanguard directly. Vanguard is an investment management firm with both a B2B and B2C businesses. Instead of going to HL, you can open up an investment account directly with Vanguard and invest in their funds directly.</p>
        
        <p>In contrast, PIMCO is a B2B only firm and doesn’t deal with retail investors like you or me. They simply work on getting their funds added as investment options on the B2C investment platforms (HL), or they will work with financial investors and instituonal invetors, theire main clients. This type of business is the focus of this guide.</p>
        
        <p>In another example, if you inherited £1 million pounds, you may decide to get a financial advisor to manage your money for you.</p>
        
        <p>The B2B investment management firm would then work with the financial advisor.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, you may have a workplace pension.</p>
            
        <h2 id="industry-specific-marketing-challenges">Industry-specific marketing challenges<a class="anchor-link" href="#industry-specific-marketing-challenges"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>Beyond day-to-day work and projects, there are a lot of factors that make the job more difficult than it needs to be:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Difficulty measuring the marketing team's contribution</strong>. The sales cycle in investment management B2B is typically non-linear and can be very long, with multiple touchpoints and decision makers along the way. Therefore, it’s essentially impossible to measure marketing’s contribution to flows accurately (despite what many marketing agencies will tell you in their pitches).</li>
          <li><strong>It’s old-fashioned</strong>. Investment management is slow moving, is relationship-led and it can still be an old-school relationship led business, where many salespeople – especially in the institutional channel – prize their clients and prefer to meet in person, with a “hands-off” mentality towards marketing. In some firms, the sales team may not want leads sent to them at all</li>
          <li><strong>Marketing often has a bad reputation around the business</strong>. To be frank, lots of marketing teams can be ineffective and project a bad experience with the sales team, rather than demonstrate how they can help sales do better at scale.</li>
          <li><strong>High profits</strong>. Investment management firms make a lot of money, and so there seems to be a lack of pressure on the marketing team. Sometimes it can feel like you're playing at your job, and that nothing you do will really have any impact. It's important to note that this is changing however, as new disrusptive companies move in and fee pressures bite</li>
        </ul>
