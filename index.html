            <p>If you’re reading this guide, you might be a digital marketer at a B2B investment firm, struggling with doing your job effectively, enacting change in your team, making your role a little more fun and rewarding, or being able to demonstrate the impact of your marketing activities to the wider business.</p>
            
            <p>During more than a decade working in digital marketing for a number of B2B investment management firms, I often came up against the same challenges and struggled to find any help that wasn’t purely theoretical. So, I decided to create something to try and help digital marketers succeed in what is a very challenging industry.</p>
            
            <p>This guide will help you to come up with a digital marketing strategy and understand how all the separate pieces fit together. I <a href="/introducing-cottington-investment-management.html">introduce a fictional investment firm</a> as a case study used throughout the book to demonstrate practical examples for you to follow. However, feel free to go straight any chapter if you want to focus on something specific, especially if larger change is hard to make at your current firm and you want to get some small wins in.</p>
            
            <p>Before we dive in, let’s begin with a very brief look at how the business-to-business investment management industry functions, and how marketing fits into the process:</p>

            <ul>
              <li class="mb-3">You will most likely be targeting financial advisors and/or institutional investors, who may invest in your firm’s products on behalf of their clients – usually through an investment vehicle such as a fund or separately managed account (SMA). These investment products will contain stocks, bonds, or other instruments; portfolio managers will actively select these instruments based on their own views and research, or they may passively follow an index.</li>
              <li class="mb-3">While they are invested, clients are charged a fee based on percentage of their portfolio value (detail about fees) – until they decide to sell. At any time, clients may top up, sell some or all of their investment, switch to a different product, invest in additional products, or rebalance their portfolio (which are often called flows).</li>
              <li>Depending on your job, you will be required to focus on two main goals: (1) utilising a variety of marketing strategies and tactics to attract new prospects, and (2) servicing existing clients.</li>
            </ul>
                      
            <h2 id="challenges-of-marketing">Challenges of marketing</h2>
            
            <p>As you have probably experienced, being part of a marketing team in a B2B investment management firm can be challenging.</p>
            
            <p>The sales cycle in investment management B2B is typically non-linear and can be very long, with multiple touchpoints and decision makers along the way – so it’s essentially impossible to measure marketing’s contribution to flows accurately (despite what many marketing agencies will tell you in their pitches). And secondly, in many ways it remains an old-fashioned, relationship-led, high-profit-margin, and highly-regulated industry, any of which can frustrate your efforts to deliver change.</p>
            
            <h3>Difficulty measuring success</h3>
            
            <p>We can use a simple example to illustrate the problems with attributing flows to marketing activity accurately, both at the industry-level and B2C vs B2B.</p>
            
            <p>Starting with a B2C example, assume for moment you are the digital marketing manager at Leaf Investments, which offers funds directly to individual investors. Any visitor to your website can open an investment account and invest directly in your funds with their own money (assuming they meet certain criteria); they simply register, choose a fund, enter the amount they would like to invest, enter their payment details, and click submit. Once complete, they are taken to an order confirmation page.</p>
            
            <p>The firm has recently launched a new fund, the Global ESG Equity Fund, which they would like you to promote. For the sake of simplicity, you decide to market the new fund with just a single email sent to every individual who currently holds an investment account with your firm; the email will highlight the fund’s main selling points, and the call-to-action (CTA) will direct recipients to the fund’s website page.</p>
            
            <p>A week after you send the email, you take a look at the results:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li class="mb-3">10,176 clients were sent the email</li>
              <li class="mb-3">98% of emails were delivered</li>
              <li class="mb-3">27% of recipients opened the email</li>
              <li class="mb-3">2% of recipients clicked on a link</li>
              <li class="mb-3">169 recipients clicked on the CTA</li>
              <li class="mb-3">162 recipients reached the fund web page</li>
              <li class="mb-3">1 recipient submitted an order in the same website session as landing on the fund web page via the email</li>
              <li>4 recipients who had clicked on the CTA had submitted orders by the week following the email send</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In your marketing automation system, you then pull a list of the specific email recipients who clicked on the CTA link and cross reference their details with your firm’s order system:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li class="mb-3">Client 1 invested £50,000 in the Global ESG Equity Fund</li>
              <li class="mb-3">Client 2 invested £100,000 in the Global ESG Equity Fund and sold £100,000 of the Global Equity Fund (in the same transaction)
              <li class="mb-3">Client 3 invested £20,000 in the Global ESG Equity Fund
              <li>Client 4 sold £10,000 of the Global Short-Term Bond Fund</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You now have your initial results: the email led to £170,000 in flows into the Global ESG Equity Fund. Of course, it’s never that simple! As one client essentially swapped their Global Equity Fund holding for the new ESG version, the email actually led to an additional £70,000 in overall net flows (which will affect actual revenue numbers). If we make some assumptions – a fee of 0.25% for both funds, an additional £1,750 in run-rate revenue, and a total cost of the campaign of £350 – we can calculate marketing ROI, which turns out to be 400%. Great job!</p>
            
            <p>Obviously, this is an overly simplistic scenario; in reality, any campaign and its outcomes would be a lot more complex. However, the main point here is that with a B2C campaign it’s relatively easy to show how your marketing campaigns have directly led to flows.</p>
            
            <p>Now imagine you were working for a B2B firm working on a similar product push. I’ll introduce Cottington Investment Management in the next chapter, but for now, all we need to know is that they work with XYZ.</p>
            
            <p>It would be complicated even further if you had sales contacting clients with a phone call, which in my experience is normally the case. Essentially, if you were working in B2B, your reporting options from here are pretty limited. Unlike in B2C, where sales generated by marketing activity can be determined clearly, it will be unclear if your marketing activity directly led to clients or prospects investing with you for the first time, selling, topping up existing investments, moving money to a different product, and so on. That part of the process sits with the sales team. As your website visitors aren’t directly investing in your products through your website, it’s essentially impossible to attribute marketing activity to flows, unless you have the brain power and technology of Google or Amazon.</p>
            
            <h3>Job challenges in the industry</h3>
            
            <p>The investment management industry is a strange one! Relationship-led. And it can still be an old-school relationship led business, where many salespeople– especially in the institutional channel – prize their clients and prefer to meet in person, with a “hands-off” mentality towards marketing. In some firms, the sales team may not want leads sent to them.</p>
            
            <p>Marketing often has a bad rep. To be frank, lots of marketing teams can be ineffective and project a bad experience with the sales team, rather than demonstrate how they can help sales do better at scale.</p>
            
            <p>Profits</p>
            
            <p>Once clients are invested, in many ways the investment management is similar to a subscription business model is a business model in which a customer must pay a recurring price at regular intervals for access to a product or service. The model was pioneered by publishers of books and periodicals in the 17th century,[1] and is now used by many businesses, websites [2] and even pharmaceutical companies in partnership with the government.</p>
            
            <p>Subscription as a Service (SaaS) businesses. Subscribers to Netflix are charged a fee each month until they decide to cancel. Similarly, in investment management, a client is charged a percentage of their portfolio value (and sometimes a performance fee) until they decide to sell their investments. The slight difference is the complexity in measuring marketing’s influence on sales. It’s not like buying a pair of shoes – you have to constantly nurture clients and hope they stick with you. While this will mostly be determined by investment performance, marketing can have an impact (rationale, conviction, education – stay invested). Active management may be a problem.</p>
            
            <p>However, there are differences. You can’t give a free trial. But can show how the investment has performed and current portfolio construction.</p>
            
            <p>Therefore, any digital marketing strategy should adapt to fit the sales process: instead of trying to generate revenue, the digital marketing team’s focus should fall within three main areas:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li class="mb-3">Lead generation: generating, qualifying, and sending leads to sales</li>
              <li class="mb-3">Engaging clients and prospects: providing content to clients and prospects on topics that they are interested in, and supporting account managers to provide high-quality client service</li>
              <li>Arming the sales and client management teams with information: make their jobs easier by sending timely and actionable information on what prospects and clients are engaging with</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In some firms, the sales team may not want leads sent to them, in which case the marketing team only need to focus on points 2 and 3. In others, they may not be ready for them, in which case it is up to the marketing team and educate and create a process to demonstrate their value.</p>
            
            <p>Another issue is the fact that investment management firms seem to make a lot of money whether you do any marketing or not. While this does reduce any pressure, it can be demoralising (if you are any good). Sometimes it feels almost as if the marketing team is “playing” at working (with some exceptions), where they work on a report that is never going to be used. If you come up against this issue, the high pay can actually become a problem as the salary you get used to will make it hard to drop down to a lower salary if you want to move to a more exciting industry. This also means that the industry is very old fashioned. Hard to make changes.</p>
            
            <p>However, a lot of the issues mentioned above will probably lessen or disappear entirely as people become sued to a more digital-first world, and also as investment management is ripe for disruption – which we can already see in many new robo-advisors – which means that competition will increase, profits will decrease, and pressure on marketing teams will increase.</p>
            
            <p>Content (pointless)</p>
            
            <p>Which brings me to the point of this book.</p>
            
            <p>Over the last decade, I have seen the level that investment firms are at versus the pitches from agencies promising the world – data lakes, personalisation, marketing automation, lead management, single customer view, marketing attribution (flows) etc, and all I see is a huge gap. While it sounds good, I have never heard any of these agencies explain how any of these could actually be achieved, or why any of it is a good idea. Maybe I’m wrong.</p>
            
            <p>While I do understand that tailoring a marketing strategy to an individual firm – with all its individual practices, people, etc –  most of the theories out there about marketing are hard to apply practically. So I thought why not start small, and demonstrate how it can actually be done with real examples. Why I’m writing this book. Too much theory, learn better with practical examples.</p>
            
            <p>That way, even if you’re starting at a firm where the marketing team is set in it’s ways, you can still achieve small wins here and there, and most of all, hve fun and enjoy going to work in the morning! I wish you the best of luck. This sounds negative, but it means we can remove that from our goal and allow us to focus on what we can achieve.</p>
            
            <p>The business model</p>
            
            <p>A financial advisor or an institutional investor may invest in a fund or strategy on behalf of their clients. At any time, they may top up, sell, switch to a different product, invest in additional products, or rebalance their portfolio.</p>
            
            <p>While they are invested, they will be regularly charged a percentage of their portfolio (which they don’t actually pay out, but will be taken out of their investments), until they decide to sell. If they buy or sell, there may be additional fees, but let’s ignore that for now.</p>
            
            <p>they most likely want to be able to check the value of their investments, decide what do with any dividends or interest payments, see the holdings within the funds, assess performance versus the funds benchmark, and receive account statements.</p>
            
            <p>They also may wish to hear the rationale of the fund manager, outlook, market commentary, and new ideas on finance or investing, or education. They may also require tools to assess performance and/or risk. Advisors may need materials to share with their clients.</p>
            
            <p>Due diligence, long sales process, multiple people. MONEY.</p>
            
            <p>CRM issues – where are client’s holdings data stored?</p>
            
            <p>Signs of intent</p>
            
            <p>Once prospects become clients, they will want to be able to see the value of their investments, decide what do with any dividends or interest payments, see underlying holdings, assess performance versus the funds benchmark, and receive account statements. They also may wish to hear the rationale of the fund manager, outlook, market or fund/strategy commentary, and new ideas on finance or investing, or education. They may also require tools to assess performance and/or risk. Advisors may want materials to use with their own clients. They care about investment process, performance, fees, and client servicing.</p>
