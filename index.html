        <p>Welcome! This guide was created to help digital marketers succeed in a very challenging industry. Existing resources on the subject tend to be laden with buzzwords and are often impossible to apply to real-world situations.</p>
        
        <h2 id="who-is-this-guide-for">Who is this guide for?<a class="anchor-link" href="#who-is-this-guide-for"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>This guide is primarily aimed at digital marketing professionals who sit within the marketing teams of B2B investment management firms. However, anyone may find parts of it useful.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-will-this-guide-help-you">How will this guide help you?<a class="anchor-link" href="#how-will-this-guide-help-you"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>This guide will help you create your own digital marketing strategy. We will use a <a href="/introducing-our-fictional-investment-management-firm.html">fictional investment management firm</a> to help explain key concepts and demonstrate how to tackle real-life projects, which you can then adapt for your own use.</p>
        
        <h2 id="an-investment-management-primer">An investment management primer<a class="anchor-link" href="#an-investment-management-primer"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>To help us understand how the industry functions, let’s start with an example. The various players in this scenario are <strong>you</strong> and <strong>me</strong> (known as <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retail investors</a>), <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> (a B2C financial services firm), and two investment management firms: <strong>Vanguard</strong> and <strong>PIMCO</strong>.</p>
       
        <h3 id="business-to-consumer-b2c">Business-to-consumer (B2C)</h3>

        <p>You and I have decided to start investing some money, rather than keeping it all in a savings account, so we head on over to the <a class="external" href="https://www.hl.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hargreaves Lansdown website</a>, fill in a form with our details, and each open an investment account.</p>
        
        <p>Once our investment accounts are open, we add money by setting up a monthly transfer of £1,000 from our bank accounts. Next, we choose what investments to buy. Picking individual stocks or bonds is not something we're interested in, because we have no idea where to start. Instead, we decide to invest in <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funds</a>.</p>

        <p>Investing in a fund will let us outsource day-to-day investment decisions to professionals at investment management firms, who will either choose which stocks and bonds to buy in their fund (called <strong>active management</strong>), or they may copy the investments in an <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">index</a> (<strong>passive management</strong>). We will have to pay a fee for these services, but we decide it will be worth the cost.</p>

        <p>After researching suitable funds on the Hargreaves Landsdown website, you plan to invest in the <a class="external" href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-global-all-cap-index-fund-gbp-acc/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund</a> to try and grow your investment over the long term. I choose the <a class="external" href="https://www.pimco.co.uk/en-gb/investments/gis/income-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIMCO GIS Income Fund</a>, which I am hoping will generate me a steady stream of income.</p>
        
        <div class="table-responsive mb-3">
          <table class="table table-bordered small text-nowrap">
            <caption>Figure 1: Our investment choices</caption>

        <p>We’re all set! Hargreaves Lansdown will automatically transfer £1,000 from our bank accounts to our investment accounts every month and invest it in our chosen funds. To check our balance, buy or sell investments, or print out statements, we simply need to login to our online account.</p>

        <h3 id="business-to-business-b2b">Business-to-business (B2B)</h3>
        
        <p>In our example above, note that retail investors like you and I don't interact with PIMCO or Vanguard directly. But there is a key difference here: Vanguard work with both retail (B2C) and professional (B2B) investors, whereas PIMCO focus only on professional (B2B) investors.</p>

        <p>This means that if you wanted to invest in the Vanguard fund, you could simply <a class="external" href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investing-explained/investment-account-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open up an investment account with Vanguard</a> and invest in the fund directly, instead of through Hargreaves Landsdown.</p>
        
        <p>In contrast, PIMCO doesn’t deal with retail investors at all. I can't invest in their fund directly through them, and have to invest indirectly through a B2C investment platform, like Hargreaves Lansdown (PIMCO will have a dedicated sales team that attempts to get their funds added as investment options on these platforms).</p>      
                     
        <p>PIMCO and Vanguard's B2B business work with two professional client groups that form the majority of their assets under management: <strong>financial advisors</strong> and <strong>institutional investors</strong>. Let's develop our example a little more to explore these.</p>
                
        <h4>Financial advisors</h4>
                
        <p>Suddently you win £1 million on the lottery. That's a lot of money, so you hire a financial advisor to help manage your money sensibly. The B2B investment management firm would then work with the financial advisor.</p>
        
        <h4>Institutional investors</h4>
        
        <p>Additionally, you may have a workplace pension.</p>
            
        <h2 id="marketing-challenges">Marketing challenges<a class="anchor-link" href="#marketing-challenges"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2>
        
        <p>Beyond day-to-day work and projects, there are a lot of factors that make the job more difficult than it needs to be.
        
        <h3>Measuring the marketing team's contribution</h3>
        
        <p>Difficulty measuring the marketing team's contribution. The sales cycle in investment management B2B is typically non-linear and can be very long, with multiple touchpoints and decision makers along the way. Therefore, it’s essentially impossible to measure marketing’s contribution to flows accurately (despite what many marketing agencies will tell you in their pitches).</p>
        
        <h3>Old-fashioned and old-school</h3>
        
        <p>It’s old-fashioned</strong>. Investment management is slow moving, is relationship-led and it can still be an old-school relationship led business, where many salespeople – especially in the institutional channel – prize their clients and prefer to meet in person, with a “hands-off” mentality towards marketing. In some firms, the sales team may not want leads sent to them at all</p>
        
        <h3>Overcoming a reputation</h3>
        
        <p>Marketing often has a bad reputation around the business. To be frank, lots of marketing teams can be ineffective and project a bad experience with the sales team, rather than demonstrate how they can help sales do better at scale.</p>
          
        <h3>Profits</h3>
        
        <p>Investment management firms make a lot of money, and so there seems to be a lack of pressure on the marketing team. Sometimes it can feel like you're playing at your job, and that nothing you do will really have any impact. It's important to note that this is changing however, as new disrusptive companies move in and fee pressures bite</p>
