          <p>Investment managers often publish forecasts for a range of equity and bond markets around the world. They make predictions of how much prices will go up or down (<a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return</a>), how volatile price changes will be (<a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volatility</a>), and how the prices of different markets will move together (<a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correlation</a>). Forecasts are long-term, usually for a period of 5 years or more.</p>
            
          <p>As an example, <a href="#">Cottington Investment Management</a> might predict that an investment in the US equity market will return on average 6% per year over the next 10 years. They might also believe that Chinese government bonds will return 1% per year over the same period, and so on. These numbers aren’t random; a team of "quants" (math whizzes) calculate forecasts based on a methodology they have created.</p>

          <p>Data is also combined to calculate forecasts for portfolios containing various combinations of investments (most commonly a portfolio made up of 60% global stocks and 40% global bonds). In addition, recommendations are made for optimal combinations of investments for portfolios.</p>
          
          <p>A full set of forecasts is known as <strong>capital market assumptions</strong>. They are usually published online and updated periodically. Forecasts may cover a range of time periods (5, 10, 20 years) and currencies (US Dollar, British Pound, Euro). Data may also be adjusted for the effects of inflation. This may require additional predictions for future currency exchange rates, inflation rates, and so on.</p>

          <p>What purpose do capital market assumptions serve? Internally, asset allocation recommendations can be used by portfolio managers around the firm. They can also inform <a href="#">model portfolios</a>, a product some investment managers offer to financial advisors. The team who created the forecasts may wish to share their work externally too, especially if they have an interesting view (along with a compelling argument). This could spark conversations with institutional investors &mdash; and potentially lead to new business.</p>

          <div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info" role="alert">
          
            <h4 id="case-study" class="mb-3">Case study</h4>
          
              <p>Cottington’s quant team would like to publish their capital market assumptions online. They believe they have some interesting perspectives to share. So far, they have created a spreadsheet with their data and a PowerPoint presentation, but now want to create some more compelling materials and reach new audiences, primarily online. They will publish new editions annually with updated views and data.</p>
          
              <p>We have been tasked with coming up with a digital marketing strategy for their capital market assumptions covering content, distribution, and any ongoing maintenance.</p>
            
          </div>

          <h2 id="our-approach" class="mt-4 mb-3">Our approach</h2>
          
          <p>To keep our approach to the campaign structured and consistent, let's work through the steps from our <a href="">campaign framework</a>.</p>
          
          <h3 id="step-1" class="mt-4 mb-3 fs-4">Step #1: Setting the campaign goal</h3>
          
          <p>From a digital marketing perspective, our aim is to help the quant team get their work in front of institutional investors – both prospects and clients. This will involve us creating, publishing, and distributing relevant content &mdash; maybe we can help establish Cottington as a thought leader.</p>
          
          <p>Rather than on only focussing on publishing content, we decide on a more comprehensive and long-term goal: building up an audience of website subscribers over time. Producing compelling content should encourage visitors to give us their details so we can send them further content when it’s published &mdash; and keep them coming back.</p>
          
          <p>Gathering subscribers means we could collect some valuable new leads for the sales team. However, as covered in chapter [X], we separate out the lead generation as a standalone project to focus on the task of generating subscriptions rather than worrying about whether those subscribers are new leads or not.</p>
          
          <p>We now need to decide if we should create a new subscription list for capital market assumptions that interested visitors can subscribe to. We decide not to, for a couple of reasons:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li class="mb-3">As capital market assumptions will only be published once a year, there will be large gaps of time when no content will be sent to subscribers.</li>
            <li>Capital market assumptions content already fits quite nicely into a topic within our existing <a href="#">website subscriptions</a>: <strong>asset allocation</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>So, our primary goal will be to grow our asset allocation subscription list by encouraging website subscriptions. More specifically, we set an objective to generate an additional 25 subscribers each year to each of the asset allocation subscription lists for US and UK institutional investors.</p>
          
          <p>Although success will be judged against our primary objective, there are some secondary goals to note:</p>

          <ul>
            <li class="mb-3">Soliciting questions from clients and prospects via the contact form on the website for the quant team to answer. We suspect based on past experience that we won’t receive many (why?), but remain hopeful.</li>
            <li class="mb-3">More website traffic with any capital market assumptions content would be nice, especially if the traffic arrives from search engines.</li>
            <li>Producing engaging content, events, etc and engagement</li>
          </ul>

          <p>How will this fit into your buyer persona? Who will find this useful?</p>

          <h3 id="step-2" class="mt-4 mb-3 fs-4">Step #2: Creating and selecting content</h3>
          
          <p>We start by researching existing capital market assumptions content that competitors have already published online. These are detailed in figure 1.</p>

          </div>
          
          <p>Three examples stand out:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li class="mb-3"><strong>PIMCO</strong> publish an <a class="external" href="https://www.pimco.com/en-us/insights/viewpoints/in-depth/pimcos-capital-market-assumptions-february-2022" target="_blank">article on their website</a> with a brief bullet-point summary of their key takeaways. They require a website registration to download a detailed PDF.</li> 
            <li class="mb-3"><strong>BlackRock</strong> maintain a <a class="external" href="https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-gb/insights/charts/capital-market-assumptions" target="_blank">webpage</a> with interactive charts, example portfolio allocations, downloadable data, their methodology, and commentary about the most recent update.</li>
            <li class="mb-3"><strong>Research Affiliates</strong> host an impressive, very detailed and fully interactive <a class="external" href="https://interactive.researchaffiliates.com/asset-allocation" target="_blank">microsite</a> on it's own subdomain with charts, filters, settings, and more. They require a website registration to use it.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Reviewing these examples with the quant team, we reach the following consensus:</p>
        
          <ul>
            <li class="mb-3">While PIMCO’s approach provides valuable extra content for the website, the URL to the latest version will keep changing. BlackRock and Research Affiliates update content on a static URL. We prefer the latter. Static URLs can be shared more easily, always show the latest content, and be linked to from other websites, which can build the page’s authority with search engines. This could improve its ranking in search engine results pages.</li>
            <li class="mb-3">BlackRock and Research Affiliates allow website visitors to interact with, filter, and download data. The team thinks visitors will appreciate this extra functionality, versus a standard article or PDF.</li>
            <li class="mb-3">PIMCO and Research Affiliates require registration to access content. We decide not to ask for this. Firstly, interested readers can subscribe or get in touch. Secondly, Cottington is not known for their capital market assumptions, so visitors are not likely to submit their details to access them.</li>
            <li class="mb-3">The quant team ask that older editions are kept available online when a new edition is published. We agree to incorporate this requirement.</li> 
            <li>In our opinion, a lot of competitors are making their content too long and complicated. Although capital market assumptions tend to be aimed at sophisticated institutional investors, we assume they browse the internet just like everyone else. We all have short attention spans on the web (this is backed up by the data). We decide to allow visitors to be able to quickly scan the main takeaways, but also to dive into more detail if they are interested.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Next, we review the list of available content options created in chapter [X], and decide on a combined approach for Cottington’s capital market assumptions:</p>

          <ul>
            <li class="mb-3">The quant team will send our team a <strong>spreadsheet</strong> with their data. Going forward, they will send over the spreadsheet with new data each time a new edition is published.</li>
            <li class="mb-3">Marketing will work with the quant team to create a designed <strong>PDF</strong>, with the full assumptions (including various tables and charts, commentary, and conclusions) and information about the team's methodology. Again, a new edition will be published annually.</li>
            <li class="mb-3">We will design and build a <strong>landing page</strong> with an interactive chart, the PDF and spreadsheet available as downloads, and encourage visitors to subscribe or get in touch. Data will be updated annually when a new edition is published, but historical versions will remain available. It will be placed in the resources section of the website.</li>
            <li class="mb-3">Marketing will publish a <strong>blog post</strong> every six months. The first post will serve as introduction; each subsequent post will provide an update. All posts will link to the landing page as the call-to-action.</li>
            <li class="mb-3">A month after each edition is published, you will host a <strong>webinar</strong> where the quant team present their research to clients and prospects who register and attend. It will also feature an interactive Q&A session with the audience.</li>
            <li class="mb-3">Once the webinar has been hosted, you will consider an <strong>additional blog post</strong> that writes up any interesting questions submitted by the audience.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Let’s take a look at our main content items that we create.</p>
          
          <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-muted fs-5">Spreadsheet</h4>
          
          <p>The quant team has already created a spreadsheet with all their data which they send over. This will be available as a download on the landing page, so we make sure it is presentable and send it back to them so they can use it as a template to use going forward. We will the data in the spreadsheet to feed the charts on the new landing page.</p>
          
          <p>An extract of the spreadsheet is shown in figure 2. As you can imagine, there is a lot of data, so the extract only shows data in USD, nominal terms, and for 5 years.</p>

          <p>We want to be able to add parameters to the URL so we can share specific versions of the landing pages. You come up with the following:</p>
          
          <p>Edition. Time period. Currency. Inflation-adjusted. If any are not included the default is selected.</p>
          
          <p>While it won’t be needed until you have published at least one more edition of capital market assumptions, you make a small request to the team who are building the landing page:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li class="mb-3">Appending a parameter to the landing page URL selects a specific edition of the capital market assumptions.</li>
            <li>If the selected edition is not the most recent, a message will be displayed on the page informing the visitor that there is a more recent version available.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>For example, let’s assume we have two editions published: (1) January 2022 and (2) August 2022. If there are no parameters added to the URL, the most recent will be shown by default.  But why would be do this? If we have a link on a blog post that links to the landing page, we can make sure the data matches.</p>
          
          <p>To display the January 2022 edition, we can append the parameter to the landing page URL like so:</p>

          <pre><code>https://cottington.com/resources/capital-market-assumptions?edition=january_2022</code></pre>

          <p>Anyone who visits the page via this link will see this version selected instead of the August 2022 edition. And because this isn’t the latest edition, they will see a message letting them know a newer one is available shown, as shown in figure 2.</p>
          
          <p>Now the content is mapped out, the team gets the spreadsheet and PDF ready. You build and publish the landing page, and then the blog post, on both the UK and US websites.</p>
          
          <h3 id="step-3" class="mt-4 mb-3 fs-4">Step #3: Choosing distribution channels and tactics</h3>
          
          <p>After reviewing our <a href="#">distribution options</a> and considering the buyer persona of our target audience (institutional investors), we decide on the following distribution plan:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li class="mb-3"><strong>Email</strong>: a standard subscription email for the blog post sent to the institutional investors asset allocation list when published</li>
            <li class="mb-3"><strong>Social media (organic)</strong>: a LinkedIn post to Cottington’s followers linking to the blog post, using geotargeting to send traffic to the relevant websites (UK/US)</li>
            <li><strong>Organic search & referral traffic</strong>: for now, we will rely on search engine and referral traffic to reach new audiences, so you do some initial keyword and link research for competitors</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>You have a few ideas for further promotion which you put aside for the moment:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Email: a plain-text email sent a week later to clients with sales coverage</li>
            <li>Social media (paid): a paid campaign on LinkedIn targeting specific users based on their job title and industry</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>LinkedIn Social post. Insight tag to encourage subscriptions retargeting users who had visited content. Carousel with main asset classes?</p>
